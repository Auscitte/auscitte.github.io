## Introduction

This is the second article in a two-part series. [Previously]({% post_url 2022-12-16-Secure-Boot-Windows-Update %}), we have established that an NVRAM variable called `dbx` contained a hash of Ubuntu's first-stage bootloader, which, `dbx` representing a revocation list of modules that had been identified as posing a threat to the operating system security objective, resulted in Ubuntu live CD being prohibited from booting. Studious by nature (and, no doubt, only the most studious of my readers chose to stay for the second part), we are aiming to prove that it was the **_KB5012170_** Windows update that placed the hash value in question into `dbx`.

How are we to approach the task at hand? The first idea that springs to mind is uninstalling the update to recover the previous `dbx` contents with the object of asserting that, unlike the most recent revocation list, it does not contain the hash. This solution, though easily implementable, is of no educational value whatsoever and, as such, will be discarded. Instead, we are going to procure the **_KB5012170_**'s setup file (i.e. update package), take it apart extracting the data that is to go into `dbx`, and see if it includes the Ubuntu's bootloader hash. 

Provided the plan sounds sufficiently interesting, let us proceed with no delay.

## On the Anatomy of Windows Updates

### The Update Package Structure

To begin with, I downloaded **_KB5012170_** update package for the version of Windows used in the experiment from [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/). Despite the disguise of `.msu` extension, inside, it turned out to be an ordinary [cabinet file][wiki-cab], as evident from the file signature.

{% highlight bash linenos %}
$ hexdump -C -n 4 windows10.0-kb5012170-x64.msu
00000000  4d 53 43 46                                       |MSCF|
00000004
{% endhighlight %}

Cabinet files are nothing more than digitally singed (which is optional) archives supporting lossless data compression. 

{% highlight none linenos %}
$ binwalk windows10.0-kb5012170-x64.msu

{% endhighlight %}

(by the way, notice that the archive is doubly-signed to ensue compatibility) The format being well-established, there is no shortage of tools for handling cabinet files; Ubuntu's _Archive Manager_, for example, will do the trick. Hiding in the archive is another cabinet file -- this time with the proper `.cab` extension -- `Windows10.0-KB5012170-x64_PSFX.cab`. I went ahead and unpacked relevant files; the resulting tree structure is presented below.

{% include orig-size-centered-fig.html filename="secure_boot_update.png" alt="?" %}

Let us focus on the entries containing the string "firmwareupdate" in their names and ignore the rest. The first item that should capture our attention is a manifest file, presumably, providing the metadata describing how the update is to be carried out. In the manifest, one discovers a line or two that would merit investigation in their own right: for example, a mysterious tag `<SecureBoot UpdateType="DbxOnly" />` -- but what interests us is the following fragment:

{% highlight xml linenos %}
<file name="dbxupdate.bin" 
      destinationPath="$(runtime.system32)\SecureBootUpdates\"
      sourceName="dbxupdate.bin" importPath="$(build.nttree)\"
      sourcePath=".\">
      <securityDescriptor name="WRP_FILE_DEFAULT_SDDL" />
      <asmv2:hash xmlns:asmv2="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v2" 
                  xmlns:dsig="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#">
          <dsig:Transforms>
              <dsig:Transform Algorithm="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:HashTransforms.Identity" />
          </dsig:Transforms>
         <dsig:DigestMethod Algorithm="http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#sha256" />
         <dsig:DigestValue>UlftZMySTmmlvwwOF9qD/RzOLIowjtvzkrluVmhhTqA=</dsig:DigestValue>
      </asmv2:hash>
</file>
{% endhighlight %}

The reason why this particular fragment should spike our interest is the fact that _Secure Boot Signature Revocation List_ (a.k.a. _Forbidden Signature Database_) maintained by UEFI forum comes in files named `dbxupdate.bin` (possibly, with a postfix signifying the target CPU architecture). (Thus, those of users tenacious enough to _own their platforms_ -- by enrolling PEK and KEK of their own -- can [download](https://uefi.org/revocationlistfile) the revocation list and perform the update manually.) By good fortune, the XML tag above seems to describe a file with this very name, "dbxupdate.bin"; there is a fair chance that its format is the same, too.

So what does the said XML snippet tell us? Firstly, an update file for the `dbx` variable, `dbxupdate.bin`, is placed into the `%windir%\System32\SecureBootUpdates` directory (presumably, before the variable's value in NVRAM is modified) and, secondly, the resulting file should have a _sha256_ hash of `UlftZMySTmmlvwwOF9qD/RzOLIowjtvzkrluVmhhTqA=`. Somewhat unconventionally, instead of a hexadecimal representation, the string is a base64-encoded binary hash value.

{% capture alert-text %}
Reading from this directory on Linux is not without its problems. 

For files that are not meant to be modified, Windows 10 introduced a data-compression mechanism, **_CompactOS_**, to save disk space, and `dbxupdate.bin` happens to be compressed in this manner. The way Windows implements _CompactOS_ is by keeping the compressed data in an alternative stream (while the stream associated with the _\$Data_ attribute remains empty) and setting up a _reparse point_ with a special tag, `IO_REPARSE_TAG_WOF = 0x80000017` (which is reflected in the value of _\$REPARSE_POINT_ attribute). A file system _filter driver_ is registered to process reparse data of this kind; it provides a decompressed file stream whenever a "read file" system call is invoked.

Depending on your Linux flavour and version, NTFS driver may not support some types of reparse points (`IO_REPARSE_TAG_WOF` in particular) by default.
{% highlight bash %}
$ ls -l ./Windows/System32/SecureBootUpdates

-rwxrwxrwx 3 * *  3 Dec  7  2019 dbupdate.bin
lrwxrwxrwx 3 * * 34 Aug 10 07:52 dbxupdate.bin -> 'unsupported reparse tag 0x80000017'
{% endhighlight %}

The issue is easily circumvented by installing the 
[ntfs-3g-system-compression][ntfs-pugin] plugin. It comes with comprehensive compilation instructions listing all the packages to be installed (in addition to `build-essentials`), hence building it should present no problem, apart from the possibility of the plugin installation script not putting the binaries where NTFS driver expects to find them. The latter is fixable, however, following the steps suggested by Jean-Pierre Andr√© [here](ttps://github.com/ebiggers/ntfs-3g-system-compression/issues/6).  

{% highlight bash %}
$ ls /usr/local/lib/ntfs-3g
ntfs-plugin-80000017.la  ntfs-plugin-80000017.so
$ strings `which ntfs-3g` | grep ntfs-plugin

$ ls /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ntfs-3g
ls: cannot access '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ntfs-3g': No such file or directory
$ sudo mkdir /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ntfs-3g
$ sudo cp /usr/local/lib/ntfs-3g/* /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ntfs-3g
{% endhighlight %}

{% endcapture %}
{% include note-box.html text=alert-text %}

Now that we have found the data file Windows used to update `dbx`, parsing it in search of Ubuntu bootloader's hash would appear to be the only remaining step. The file format [specification][uefi-spec] publicly available, we will look though `dbxupdate.bin`, locate the hash, and we are home free, right? Well, no. We don't call ourselves studious for nothing! :-D Take another look at the prototype of `SetVariable()`, a function defined in UEFI and intended to set values of NVRAM variables.

{% highlight c linenos %}
EFI_STATUS SetVariable(IN CHAR16* VariableName, 
                       IN EFI_GUID* VendorGuid, 
                       IN UINT32 Attributes,
                       IN UINTN DataSize, 
                       IN VOID* Data);
{% endhighlight %}

The function parameter `Attributes` holds an OR-combination of various flags. Among them is `EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE`, an attribute determining whether the data passed to the function in the `Data` parameter rewrites the existing variable value or is appended to it. In case of the former, presence of a hash in the update file does not guarantee it is this hash that is being added. 
Unfortunately, whether Microsoft chose to call `SetVariable()` with `EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE` set, thereby making the `dbx` updates incremental, or not is something we do not know yet.

This turn of events considered, the fact that a copy of `dbxupdate.bin` remains on disk is good news for getting hold of the previous version of `dbxupdate.bin` may help in our pursuit. If the previous version of `dbx` update file does not contain a hash value, while the latest one does, then we can safely assume that, irrespective of whether the `EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE` flag was set, the latest update intended to add the value in question. To this end, I checked _Volume Shadow Snapshots_ for old files in `%windir%\System32\SecureBootUpdates`.

{% capture alert-text %}
Based on my [experience]({% post_url 2021-04-20-Registry-Recovery %}), I would recommend [libvshadow][libvshadow] for browsing Windows VSS on Linux on account of the library having proved functional and stable.

### Differential Updates

An earlier "shadow" copy of `SecureBootUpdates` would have made my life a breeze. Alas! The computer I used did not have one. We will have to get back to it later; for now, let us switch gears and consider the second discovery. Why would the manifest need to specify `dbxupdate.bin`'s hash? It is files that are either generated or downloaded separately that need to be checked for errors. Does a fresh copy of `dbxupdate.bin` come along with the update .cab? It turns out, it does not (though, file hashes happens to be a standard feature of manifest files not connected to the update technology); rather, `dbxupdate.bin` is generated based on an old version of the same, already resident on user's computer, and one or more small differentials (delta files), arriving as part of the update; a so-called **_differential compression_** technique is applied to pre-compute the deltas and then decompress the target file on site. For details, I refer the reader to Microsoft's [white paper][update-whitepaper], which is concise enough so as to constitute little to no distraction from the main narrative. Please, go ahead and at least skim though the material.

To recap the white paper, in case an old version of the file being updated is on the computer, residing alongside it, one will find a **_reverse differential_** (stored in the folder named `./r`), a delta file that, when applied to the file already on the PC, produces a _base version_ of thereof, while the update package will contain a **_forward differential_** (arriving in the folder named `./f`), which is then applied to the reconstructed _base version_ in order to obtain the end result. By a **_base version_**, Microsoft means either the file contained in the latest major OS release or an RTM version. The resulting, updated, file along with the reverse and forward differentials are saved in `%windir%\WinSxS`.

The latter sounds promising since it suggests the possibility that the `dbxupdate.bin` file involved in the previous update of `dbx` might have been stored in `WinSxS`. Sure enough, I found two folders pertaining to the updates of this kind: one with `dbxupdate.bin` for _KB5012170_, compete with the differentials identical to those contained in the package downloaded from Microsoft _Update Catalog_, and another -- for some earlier update. It only had `dbxupdate.bin` inside (no `./r`, `./f` or `./n` for that matter), thus, I assume, to deploy it, a method other than differential compression was utilized. 

Now that we, ostensibly, have a previous version of `dbxupdate.bin` at our disposal, we would do well to verify that applying the differentials to it in the order prescribed by the white paper results in `dbxupdate.bin` identical to that in `SecureBootUpdates`. In order to find a tool that would perform "differential decompression" for us, we must first identify the file format. 

{% highlight none linenos %}
$ hexdump -n 16 -C ./KB5012170/u/f/dbxupdate.bin
00000000  b4 4b 01 63 50 41 33 30  a6 30 83 3b 8d 95 d8 01  |.K.cPA30.0.;....|
00000010
{% endhighlight %}

The `PA30` signature leads us to another excellent resource on recent developments in Windows update technology -- [this post][diff-patch] by Jaime Geiger. It offers helpful insights into specifics of Windows update operation and format of update patches, but, more importantly, provides a [python script](https://gist.github.com/wumb0/9542469e3915953f7ae02d63998d2553#file-delta_patch-py) to apply the differentials. However, the script uses Microsoft _Delta Compression API_ and, for this reason, it is only usable under Windows. So into the land of Windows we go. Get your canes (or broomsticks, to each her own) ready. 

You will find dealing with cabinet files in Windows equally painless: simply use the `expand -f:* <path to .cab> <output directory>` command. Since there is no accompanying reverse differential, we will treat the oldest of the two `dbxupdate.bin` files residing in `WinSxS` as base.

Notice that the resulting _sha256_ hash matches the one specified in the manifest. 

{% capture alert-text %}
What is more, the fact that the script completed successfully, in itself, speaks in favor of our guess being correct since the _Delta Compression API_ seems to be equipped with a safeguard against improper application of differentials. Pass a wrong (i.e. computed for a file other than the one in the input buffer) differential to `ApplyDeltaB()` and, in all probability, the function will fail, with `GetLastError()` returning 13 (which translates into the "The data is invalid" message).

The remaining two sections could be skipped upon the first reading. Those of my readers who believe their lives are too short for dull long-winded explanations are welcome to continue with the study at [this section]({% post_url 2023-02-10-Dbxupdate-Parse %}#a-peek-inside-the-dbx-update).

### An Assembly for The Secure Boot Variables Update 

It all worked out rather well, will you not agree? A quick two-minute search over the _WinSxS_ directory results in almost (differential updates have been adopted relatively recently) entire update history for a file. But why spend two minutes running a search, when one can automate the task in under 24 hours? Right? Thus, I wrote a [python script](https://github.com/Auscitte/sys-utils/blob/main/win_read_winsxs.py) that, given a file name, would traverse the _WinSxS_ directory collecting all the relevant paths and establishing relations between multiple versions of the given file (implementation notes can be found [here]({% post_url 2023-02-09-Exploring-WinSxS %})). Here is the output my script produces for `dbxupdate.bin`.

dbxupdate.bin: 10.0.19041.1‚óã ==> 10.0.19041.1880
{% endhighlight %}

`dbxupdate.bin` has been discovered to belong to the `amd64_microsoft-windows-s..boot-firmwareupdate_none` assembly (assembly in the broadest sense of the word for it does not contain executable images); of this assembly, there are two versions currently available in _WinSxS_: `10.0.19041.1`, identified as a base version (of which we are informed by the &omicron; symbol), and `10.0.19041.1880`, that can be derived from the base version by the way of applying a forward differential (as indicated by the "==&gt;" sign).

As mentioned before, the `dbxupdate.bin` file stored as part of the most recent revision (1880) of the assembly is identical to that found in `%windir%\System32\SecureBootUpdates`. 

{% highlight none linenos %}

8d9919cb58914a1f234c682d247a6ee2
CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.
{% endhighlight %}

Furthermore, the differential files residing in the assembly's `.\r` and `.\f` subdirectories are exactly the same as those that arrived in the update _.cab_ (you will have to take my word for it since I have chosen to spare you a rather long-winded _certutil_ output). Also, notice that the directory (inside the update package; see the update tree structure at the very beginning of the section) containing the differentials bears the same name as the assembly, `amd64_microsoft-windows-s..boot-firmwareupdate_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19041.1880_none_294d9e3cbae1ff57`. 

Taking everything into account, one can come up with an approximate sequence of steps involved in installing the **_KB5012170_** update: 
1. The installer unpacks the update archive and identifies the assembly name by examining the manifest.  
1. The installer locates the most recent version of `amd64_microsoft-windows-s..boot-firmwareupdate_none` currently on the computer, 10.0.19041.1.
1. Seeing that it is a _base version_, no reverse differential is necessary (neither is it present, for that matter).
1. Applying a _forward differential_ from the update _.cab_, the installer reconstructs a new version of `dbxupdate.bin`.
1. The newly generated `dbxupdate.bin`, along with the _forward differential_ used to obtain it and a _reverse differential_ necessary for future updates are copied to _WinSxS_ under a directory named `amd64_microsoft-windows-s..boot-firmwareupdate_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19041.1880_none_294d9e3cbae1ff57`.
1. The installer copies `dbxupdate.bin` to `%windir%\System32\SecureBootUpdates`, modifies the registry as instructed by the manifest, and initiates an update of the NVRAM variable. 


This is the working hypothesis. What took place in reality, only the kernel almighty knows, but the net result is that we have at our disposal the latest and the previous versions of `dbxupdate.bin`... Or do we? The forward differential being applied to the base rather than the latest available version, theoretically, nothing prevents the possibility of another update (of which our "testing grounds" system for some reason bears no record) "squeezing in" between the deployment of the 10.0.19041.1 and 10.0.19041.1880 assemblies.

### An Extra Check for Better Sleep 

The possibility is far fetched, I will be the first one to admit, but, to be on the safe side, I searched for other dbx-related Window updates released between 2019-12-07 and 2022-08-10 (see the timestamps in the output of `python win_read_winsxs.py`). Two updates only met the criteria:  [KB4575994](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-guidance-for-applying-secure-boot-dbx-update-kb4575994-e3b9e4cb-a330-b3ba-a602-15083965d9ca) and [KB4535680](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb4535680-security-update-for-secure-boot-dbx-january-12-2021-f08c6b00-a850-e595-6147-d0c32ead81e2). The former one was discarded right away due to the lack of automation: Microsoft offers no _.msu_ file for this update; instead, users are suggested to download the latest `dbxupdate.bin` from the [uefi.org](https://uefi.org/) and invoke a _Power Shell_ script in order to install it. It would be extremely out of character for a person who owns this computer to partake in so precarious an enterprise ;-) I vouch for her. Thus, we are left with the update labeled **_KB4535680_** as the only contender. 

Even with this, rather welcome, reduction in the number of updates to check, the challenges were not over. The update log did not go far back enough for me to determine if and when the update in question was installed and what the Windows version was at that time, so I downloaded all available _.msu_ files for the Windows edition I was working with. Of these, two had declared in their manifests the same target hashes as that of `dbxupdate.bin` version 10.0.19041.1 (the remaining three specified a different value). Moreover, in spite of the fact that the update was dated January 12, 2021, the files inside were much older, older, in fact, than `dbxupdate.bin`, ver. 10.0.19041.1, according to its "last modified" timestamp (2019-12-07). For example,

{% highlight none linenos %}
$ ls ./KB4535680/u -R -l
./KB4535680/u:
total 8
drwxrwxr-x 2 * * 4096 Sep  8 15:55 f
drwxrwxr-x 2 * * 4096 Sep  8 15:55 r

./KB4535680/u/f:
total 8
-rw-rw-r-- 1 * *   46 Sep 23  2019 dbupdate.bin
-rw-rw-r-- 1 * * 1368 Sep 23  2019 dbxupdate.bin

./KB4535680/u/r:
total 8
-rw-rw-r-- 1 * *   46 Sep 23  2019 dbupdate.bin
-rw-rw-r-- 1 * * 2840 Sep 23  2019 dbxupdate.bin
{% endhighlight %}

Its respectable age had also been betrayed by the assembly versions the update was to install: 10.0.17763.793, 10.0.18362.411, 10.0.14393.3001, 10.0.10240.18575, and 10.0.17134.1060 -- all of it leading me to the conclusion that _KB4535680_ could not have been deployed **_after_** the  `amd64_microsoft-windows-s..boot-firmwareupdate_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19041.1_none_6ab72e7ea4dfef1b` assembly was.    

{% capture alert-text %}
Of course, this rather tedious way of establishing the exact update sequence is something this study could easily do without; the real reason for going into such depths was to bring to the reader's attention some idiosyncrasies of Windows updates they may encounter.

Only now do I claim with a fair degree of confidence that I have in my possession two consecutive versions of `dbxupdate.bin`. 

## A Peek Inside the DBX Update

All the necessary versions of `dbxupdate.bin` secured, how are we to go about comparing them? A cursory glance at the _hexdump_ output reveals that both files are binary, and so the hope is that they comply with the same format as their namesakes found on UEFI forum's website. It is quite rare that reality lives up to our expectations; in this case, however, we discover that, for once, not only does it meet the expectations, but exceeds them :-) for the `dbxupdate.bin` installed by **_KB5012170_** is identical to that most recently published by the Forum.

As a result, we can safely rely on the ready-made utilities to handle the files and, if none suits us, consult the publicly available specification while implementing our own.

For those who are keeping score, the same `dbxupdate.bin` file has turned up at four different locations:
1. Among the files generated by applying the _KB5012170_ update.
1. `%windir%\System32\SecureBootUpdates`.
1. In `%windir%\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-s..boot-firmwareupdate_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19041.1880_none_294d9e3cbae1ff57`.
1. On UEFI Forum site (as of August of 2022, it is the latest revocation list there).

### A Quick Tour of the Data Structures

What we need is a parser that would dump the structures stored inside the `dbxupdate.bin`file in a human-readable text format, but before we set out on the quest of procuring one, let us familiarize ourselves with the said data structures. Apart from the [specification][uefi-spec], I would recommend [this blog post][dbx-parse] by Peter Jones as an easy-to-follow guide to the revocation list updates file format. 

Secure Boot dictates that `dbx` be a so-called **_authenticated variable_** meaning that whenever its new value is passed to the `SetVariable` function, it is always prefixed by an authentication structure; which one is determined by the attributes of the variable. On Linux, `dbx`'s attribute bitmask is stored in the first four bytes of the `/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/dbx-d719b2cb-3d3a-4596-a3bc-dad00e67656f` file. I went ahead and extracted the flags:

{% highlight python linenos %}
>>> with open("/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/dbx-d719b2cb-3d3a-4596-a3bc-dad00e67656f", "rb") as f:
...     attrs = int.from_bytes(f.read(4), byteorder = "little")
... 
>>> ad = { 0x1 : "EFI_VARIABLE_NON_VOLATILE", 0x2 : "EFI_VARIABLE_BOOTSERVICE_ACCESS",
...        0x4 : "EFI_VARIABLE_RUNTIME_ACCESS", 0x8 : "EFI_VARIABLE_HARDWARE_ERROR_RECORD",
...        0x10 : "EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS", 0x20 : "EFI_VARIABLE_TIME_BASED_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS",
...        0x40 : "EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE", 0x80 : "EFI_VARIABLE_ENHANCED_AUTHENTICATED_ACCESS" }
>>> print(*[ ad[ ((1 << s) & attrs) ] for s in range(0, 32) if (attrs & (1 << s) ) != 0 ], sep = "\n")
EFI_VARIABLE_NON_VOLATILE
EFI_VARIABLE_BOOTSERVICE_ACCESS
EFI_VARIABLE_RUNTIME_ACCESS
EFI_VARIABLE_TIME_BASED_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS
{% endhighlight %}

There you have it: `dbx` persists across reboots, is accessible in both, preboot and runtime (i.e. after the OS boots), environments, and, most importantly, is authenticated with the contents of an `EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATION_2`  structure. The update file is, therefore, organized as follows:

{% highlight none linenos %}
EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATION_2  (EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST*)
{% endhighlight %}

i.e. an instance of `EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATION_2` followed by zero (deletes the variable) or more `EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST` instances. 

Let us examine the structures one by one. `EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATION_2` contains a time stamp (which will be omitted from the discussion) and authentication information.

{% highlight c linenos %}
typedef struct {
    EFI_TIME                   TimeStamp;
    WIN_CERTIFICATE_UEFI_GUID  AuthInfo;
} EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATION_2;
{% endhighlight %}

Having found the definition of `WIN_CERTIFICATE_UEFI_GUID` given in the specification slightly confusing, I came up with another, fields-wise equivalent, layout of the structure, based on Peter Jones' helpful explanation. Here it is:

{% highlight c linenos %}
typedef struct _WIN_CERTIFICATE_UEFI_GUID {
    UINT32    dwLength;
    UINT16    wRevision;
    UINT16    wCertificateType;
    EFI_GUID  CertType;
    //UINT8   CertData[dwLength - sizeof(UINT32) - 2 * sizeof(UINT16) - sizeof(EFI_GUID)];
} WIN_CERTIFICATE_UEFI_GUID;
{% endhighlight %}

When `WIN_CERTIFICATE_UEFI_GUID` is embedded into `EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATION_2`, `wCertificateType` is set to `WIN_CERT_TYPE_EFI_GUID`, `CertType` -- initialized to `EFI_CERT_TYPE_PKCS7_GUID`, and `CertData` contains DER-encoded **_SignedData_** structure from **_PKCS\#7 version 1.5_** ([RFC 2315][rfc2315]). The latter defined in a standard, there are plenty of libraries to parse it. The data being signed consists of `VariableName`, `VendorGuid`, and `Attributes` parameter values (as passed to `SetVariable()`), augmented by the contents of `EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATION_2::TimeStamp` and all the `EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST` instances concatenated.

Speaking of `EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST`, its definition is presented below.

{% highlight c linenos %}
typedef struct _EFI_SIGNATURE_DATA {
    EFI_GUID  SignatureOwner;
    //UINT8   SignatureData[ (EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST*)parent->SignatureSize - 
    //                       sizeof(GUID) ];
} EFI_SIGNATURE_DATA;

typedef struct _EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST {
    EFI_GUID   SignatureType;
    UINT32     SignatureListSize;
    UINT32     SignatureHeaderSize;
    UINT32     SignatureSize;
    //UINT8    SignatureHeader[SignatureHeaderSize];
    //EFI_SIGNATURE_DATA  Signatures[ (SignatureListSize - sizeof(EFI_GUID) -
    //                                 3 * sizeof(UINT32) - SignatureHeaderSize) / 
    //                                 SignatureSize ];
} EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST;
{% endhighlight %}

Despite the name, an instance of `EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST` is, technically, not a list, by an array of equisized `EFI_SIGNATURE_DATA` structures prefixed by a (28 + `SignatureHeaderSize`)-byte header. For this reason, there need be multiple instances of `EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST`, one per value of the (`SignatureType`, `SignatureSize`) tuple, in the update file and whenever an update file includes X.509 certificates, as a rule, each is placed in a separate signature list (since X.509 certificates differ in length). `SignatureType` determines how signature header is interpreted and its size as well as format of `EFI_SIGNATURE_DATA::SignatureData`.
`EFI_SIGNATURE_DATA::SignatureOwner` identifies the agent who added the signature.

UEFI defines an impressive variety of ways to identify the entity being revoked. Listed below are all possible values of `SignatureType` (so that the reader may share in the fascination).   

* `EFI_CERT_SHA256_GUID`: a _sha256_ hash
* `EFI_CERT_RSA2048_GUID`: an _rsa2048_ key
* `EFI_CERT_RSA2048_SHA256_GUID`: an _rsa2048_ signature of a _sha256_ hash
* `EFI_CERT_SHA1_GUID`: a _sha1_ hash
* `EFI_CERT_RSA2048_SHA1_GUID`: an _rsa2048_ signature of a _sha1_ hash
* `EFI_CERT_X509_GUID`: a DER-encoded _X.509_ certificate
* `EFI_CERT_SHA224_GUID`: a _sha224_ hash
* `EFI_CERT_SHA384_GUID`: a _sha384_ hash
* `EFI_CERT_SHA512_GUID`: a _sha512_ hash
* `EFI_CERT_X509_SHA256_GUID`: a _sha256_ hash of an _X.509_ certificate

In practice, I came across two types of revocation list entries only: `EFI_CERT_SHA256_GUID`, a _sha256_ hash of a UEFI executable where a vulnerability had been found, and `EFI_CERT_X509_GUID`, a DER-encoded _X.509_ certificate that had been either used to sign (a family of) faulty UEFI modules or compromised in some other way.

On this note, I am concluding this hasty overview of `dbx` update files organization; whatever structure definitions I might have missed, can easily be found in the UEFI specification.

### Inside dbxupdate.bin

Naturally, readers should feel free to use a `dbx` update parser of their choosing; I, however, decided to implement [my own](https://github.com/Auscitte/sys-utils/blob/main/dbxupdate_parser.py) for the occasion since, where reverse-engineering matters are concerned, hands-on experience is by far the best way of learning. Besides, my parser is written in python, a universal language everyone speaks. 

My script accepts paths to `dbxupdate.bin` and a (optional) DER-encoded certificate to be used as a root when the chain of trust involved in authenticating the update is constructed. For the script to work correctly, it must be a certificate stored in _KEK_. Here is the output this script produces for **_KB5012170_**.

Commenting the dump line by line would be an undertaking ludicrous beyond imagination, so, instead, I will only list a few points of interest. First of all, the update, judging by the timestamp, appears to be rather... dated. In fact, the timestamp is initialized to a particular value, the same in all the `dbx` update files (from Microsoft and UEFI Forum alike) I could get my hands on. Here is what the UEFI specification has to say on the subject: _"In certain environments a reliable time source may not be available. In this case, an implementation may still add values to an authenticated variable since the `EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE` attribute, when set, disables timestamp verification."_

Second of all, one must pay attention when interpreting **_PKCS\#7 SignedData_** stored in `Auth2.AuthInfo.CertData`. Notice that the common name of the signing entity is indicated as `Microsoft Corporation KEK CA 2011`, but the fingerprint that follows does not match that of the actual certificate.

{% highlight none linenos %}
$ openssl x509 -in MicCorKEKCA2011_2011-06-24.crt --fingerprint -noout
SHA1 Fingerprint=31:59:0B:FD:89:C9:D7:4E:D0:87:DF:AC:66:33:4B:39:31:25:4B:30
{% endhighlight %}

The discrepancy is explained by the fact that this data is obtained by parsing the **_signerInfos_** field of **_SignedData_**, where the signer's certificate is specified by the "**_issuer_** distinguished name" (see  [RFC2315][rfc2315]). To understand what is happening here, one must turn to the X.509 certificates that also come embedded in _SignedData_; the **_certificates_** field is what the script relies on when building a chain of trust. Upon examining `CertData.Chain`, it becomes clear that the new `dbx` value is signed with a certificate bearing a common name of `Microsoft Windows UEFI Key Exchange Key` (its fingerprint computing to `c6:c6:8c:9b:d8:83:e1:44:69:c7:25:25:12:01:04:3f:b7:d4:c3:cd`) and this certificate chains to `Microsoft Corporation KEK CA 2011`.

Finally, this update file contains one signature list only; its entries are all _sha256_ hashes as indicated by the value of `SignatureType`, which is equal to `{c1c41626-504c-4092-a9ac-41f936934328}` (`EFI_CERT_SHA256_GUID`). The only other type of signatures I encountered "in the wild" is `{a5c059a1-94e4-4aa7-b587-ab155c2bf072}` (`EFI_CERT_X509_GUID`). Below is a dump of such a `dbx` update file.

Take a note of the way certificates are stored, each in is own signature list with the value of `SignatureSize` set to the certificate length (plus `sizeof(GUID)`).

### The Proof

All the forewords, introductions, and groundwork out of the way, we can finally get to what we have set out to do in the first place, which is to prove that it was the **_KB5012170_** Windows update that placed a hash of `BOOTx64.EFI`, Ubuntu's first stage bootloder, into `dbx`. As a reminder, I am restating the assumption we are working under: _"If the previous version of `dbx` update file does not contain a hash value, while the latest one does, then we can safely assume that, irrespective of whether the `EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE` flag was set, the latest update intended to add the value in question."_ Of course, this assumption would break if the attributes passed to `SetVariable()` changed from one update to another, but it is unlikely to be the case. 

Let us first find out what hash value to look for.

{% highlight bash linenos %}
$ python3 pe_sig_hash.py ./LiveCD/EFI/BOOT/BOOTx64.EFI
007f4c95125713b112093e21663e2d23e3c1ae9ce4b5de0d58a297332336a2d8
{% endhighlight %}

Why not try our hand at checking an update file for hashes using the newly implemented parser? I deemed it more convenient to run it within a python interpreter rather than as a script. 

{% highlight python linenos %}
>>> from dbxupdate_parser import DbxUpdate
>>> import os
>>> upd = DbxUpdate(os.path.expandvars("%windir%\\System32\\SecureBootUpdates\\dbxupdate.bin"), None)
>>> len(upd.upd.SignatureLists)
1
>>> #There is one signature list only in the update file; it holds hashes
>>> upd_hashes = { s.SignatureData for s in upd.upd.SignatureLists[0].Signatures }
>>> "007f4c95125713b112093e21663e2d23e3c1ae9ce4b5de0d58a297332336a2d8" in upd_hashes
True
{% endhighlight %}

As expected, the latest `dbxupdate.bin` contains `BOOTx64.EFI`'s hash. What about `dbxupdate.bin` from the previous Windows update?

{% highlight python linenos %}
>>> upd_prev = DbxUpdate(os.path.expandvars("%windir%\\WinSxS\\amd64_microsoft-windows-s..boot-firmwareupdate_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19041.1_none_6ab72e7ea4dfef1b\\dbxupdate.bin"), None)
>>> len(upd_prev.upd.SignatureLists)
1
>>> upd_prev_hashes = { s.SignatureData for s in upd_prev.upd.SignatureLists[0].Signatures }
>>> "007f4c95125713b112093e21663e2d23e3c1ae9ce4b5de0d58a297332336a2d8" in upd_prev_hashes
False
{% endhighlight %}

This time we do not find `BOOTx64.EFI`'s hash value in the signature list. Q.E.D.

### Unplanned Experiments and Serendipitous Discoveries

Well, the previous section went by fast. Do not know about you, but to me, the culmination, the proof we had been working towards all this time, seemed a bit anticlimactic. So much effort was put in: studying Secure Boot PKI, dissecting Windows updates, figuring out the update file format, and even implementing a parser, and for what? For something so trivial as determining if both files contain a single miserable string of bytes?

I tell you what, why do we not conduct a few more simple experiments using the parser just developed, solve a mystery or two whilst gaining valuable insights into `dbx` updates? Are you in?

The first question in our agenda arises owing to one of our earlier observations. We have discovered that `dbxupdate.bin` arriving with the latest Windows update is identical to the same most recently released by UEFI forum. Are all updates to `dbx` issued by Microsoft mere copies of fruits of UEFI forum's labor? To answer this question, we must get our hands on `dbxupdate.bin`s extracted from other Windows updates and these files are not easy to come by. This is when [Winbindex][winbindex] developed by Michael Maltsev comes to the rescue. **_Winbindex_** provides various versions of executable files (.exe, .dll, and .sys) that constitute Windows operating system; thus, one can download the entire update history of say, _kernel32.dll_ beginning from the one found in Windows 10, release 1507, through all Windows updates and releases, up to the latest version (a functionality indispensable for systems and security researches). Where non-executable files are concerned, the capabilities are limited, however; at the time of writing, available for `dbxupdate.bin` is only meta-data, describing the files (hashes, sizes, and Windows versions), not the files themselves, and only base versions of `dbxupdate.bin` are included. Here is the data, albeit greatly edited down to save space.

We have hashes of all the base versions of `dbxupdate.bin` (there are three of them) in addition to that of the file contained in latest update to `dbx`, four in total.

{% endhighlight %}

The very first Microsoft's `dbxupdate.bin` (included in release 1507 of Windows 10) is the same as the first `dbxupdate.bin` ever published by UEFI forum (in 2014); the latest versions of the file from these two parties are identical as well. On the midmost entries, the (ordered) file sets disagree.

They embarked on the journey together sharing the perfect vision of future to come, cherishing the same heart's desire to set the world right, then went their separate ways only to meet again on that fateful day, Tuesday, the 9th of August, 2022. While you are looking for a tissue, I will concoct the morale of this touching story: even if things look indistinguishable on the outside, it does not mean they deeply (or even at all) agree on the inside or, in other words, `dbxupdate.bin` files released by Microsoft and UEFI forum have the same format, but not necessarily the same content.

The next question we will undertake the task of answering is whether Windows `dbx` updates are "incremental" (in the sense that the content of the update file is appended to what is already in `dbx`) or not (i.e. the update installer overwrites the `dbx` value). To this end, we will check if the set of module hashes found `dbxupdate.bin` is a superset of that stored in `dbx`. 

Obtaining `dbx`'s value on Linux is as easy as reading from the file 	`/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/dbx-d719b2cb-3d3a-4596-a3bc-dad00e67656f`. On Windows, we have a special API call and access rights to grapple with. To save you research effort and implementation time, I wrote a [script](https://github.com/Auscitte/sys-utils/blob/main/win_get_uefi_var.py) that would dump to a binary file a value of the NVRAM variable whose name is passed as a parameter. 

{% highlight none linenos %}
>python win_get_uefi_var.py dbx dbx.esl 
{% endhighlight %}

`dbx.esl` being binary, the question arises: how are we to read it? Well, my parser is marked by a certain degree of versatility. Conveniently enough, it can be utilized to parse values of `dbx` and `db` variables (in addition to update files).

{% highlight python linenos %}
>>> from dbxupdate_parser import DbxUpdate, EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST
>>> import construct as cs
>>> upd = DbxUpdate(os.path.expandvars("%windir%\\System32\\SecureBootUpdates\\dbxupdate.bin"), None)
>>> upd_hashes = { s.SignatureData for s in upd.upd.SignatureLists[0].Signatures }
>>> with open("dbx.esl", "rb") as f:
...     dbx = f.read()
...
>>> dbx_liststs = cs.GreedyRange(EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST).parse(dbx)
>>> len(dbx_liststs)
1
>>> dbx_hashes = { s.SignatureData for s in dbx_liststs[0].Signatures }
>>> dbx_hashes.issuperset(upd_hashes)
True
>>> dbx_hashes.issubset(upd_hashes)
False
>>> len(dbx_hashes.difference(upd_hashes))
51
{% endhighlight %}

On top of all the hashes that arrived packed in the latest update file, `dbx` includes 51 that did not. Where do they come from? One possibility is that these hashes were preloaded by the manufacturer, in which case they are likely to reside in `dbxDefault`, a variable that holds a default value of `dbx`. 

{% highlight none linenos %}
>python win_get_uefi_var.py dbxDefault dbxDefault.esl 
{% endhighlight %}

`dbxDefault` complies with the same format as does `dbx`, hence the parsing method is the same as well. 

{% highlight python linenos %}
>>> with open("dbxDefault.esl", "rb") as f:
...     dbx_def = f.read()
...
>>> print(cs.GreedyRange(EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST).parse(dbx_def))
ListContainer:
    Container:
        SignatureType = u'{c1c41626-504c-4092-a9ac-41f936934328}' (total 38)
        SignatureListSize = 76
        SignatureHeaderSize = 0
        SignatureSize = 48
        SignatureHeader = b'' (total 0)
        Signatures = ListContainer:
            Container:
                SignatureOwner = u'{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}' (total 38)
                SignatureData = u'0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000' (total 64) 
{% endhighlight %}

As we see, `dbxDefault` only holds a dummy all-zeros entry, therefore the 51 extra hashes must have been installed by earlier `dbx` updates, which clearly indicates incremental nature of the said updates, right? Then how would you explain this? 

{% highlight python linenos %}
>>> upd_prev = DbxUpdate(os.path.expandvars("%windir%\\WinSxS\\amd64_microsoft-windows-s..boot-firmwareupdate_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.19041.1_none_6ab72e7ea4dfef1b\\dbxupdate.bin"), None)
>>> upd_hashes.issuperset(upd_prev_hashes)
True
{% endhighlight %}

The previous `dbxupdate.bin` is entirely contained in the latest one. Perhaps, the nature of updates changed over time. 
My suggestion is to go over the entire update history of `dbxupdate.bin`, examining the consecutive items of the file sequence in a pairwise fashion. Recall that we have learned hashes of four different `dbxupdate.bin`s, each used at some point to set the value of `dbx`. Of them, two belong to files residing in _WinSxS_ and one -- to `dbxupdate.bin` that, although not present in the system, can be easily downloaded from UEFI forum's site. There is only one file we do not have a copy of on our list. Here is what its _sha256_ hash looks like, base64-encoded.

Lovely though the sting is in its own right, I am actually going somewhere with this. I appeal to your memory yet again; do you remember the **_KB4535680_** update, that I found and downloaded only to discover that it generated the version of `dbxupdate.bin` I already had (if not, skim though the [this]({% post_url 2023-02-10-Dbxupdate-Parse %}#an-extra-check-for-better-sleep) section)? It transpired, the target file already resided in _WinSxS_, under the assembly version `10.0.19041.1`. What _WinSxS_ did not contain is differentials of any kind, but the update package did: in particular, a reverse differential allowing to reconstruct the preceding version of `dbxupdate.bin`, which, as its hash will tell you, is exactly the missing file we need.

Now that we have the set of four `dbxupdate.bin` files in its entirety at our disposal, let us make a rather bold assumption that this is a complete list of `dbx` update files ever released by Microsoft. With this assumption in mind, we can try and establish set-theoretic (loosely speaking) relations between sets of hashes in consecutive files; to this end, we define a few aux functions (available in the form of a [single script](https://gist.github.com/Auscitte/65337dd77c4a9375e5d1711e08165056) for the convenience of those wishing to replicate the experiment).

Updates from Microsoft do not include X.509 certificates at all: module hashes is the only type of signatures one can find there. As for the set inclusion, the test is inconclusive: sometimes the entire set of hashes is carried to the next update, other times only some hashes make it there, while others get removed.
 
As a last resort, let us merge all the updates together and compare the resulting set of hashes to that held in `dbx`.

Firstly, I am happy to inform you that we were right in our assumption that we had at our disposal a complete set of the update files.

Despite all the perturbations in the content of update files, in `dbx` itself, hashes were only added, never deleted or, to put it another way, none of the signatures loaded by an update was removed by the surpassing updates. Evidently, `SetVariable()` was always called with the  `EFI VARIABLE APPEND WRITE`flag set. Given non-empty intersections, such a procedure is sure to create duplicates thereby resulting in the waste of precious NVRAM space. It turns out not to be the case; here is a quote from UEFI specification:

>For variables with the GUID `EFI_IMAGE_SECURITY_DATABASE_GUID` (i.e. where the data buffer is formatted as `EFI_SIGNATURE_LIST`), the driver shall not perform an append of `EFI_SIGNATURE_DATA` values that are already part of the existing variable value. [...] This situation is not considered an error, and shall in itself not cause a status code other than `EFI_SUCCESS` to be returned or the timestamp associated with the variable not to be updated. 

(That is, UEFI firmware is required to perform a proper union of the signatures being added and those already in `dbx`.)

This small, yet important, note is easy to miss in the vast spaces of UEFI specification; it is Peter Jones's [blog post][dbx-parse] that brought it to my attention.
{% endcapture %}
{% include note-box.html text=alert-text %}

On this note, I consider the question of whether the Windows `dbx` updates are incremental answered. Since we created a "framework" (if this meager set of python functions could be viewed as such) for this type of experiments, why not used it to figure out if the UEFI forum's updates have the same property?

Right off the bat, we notice the similarity: a newly released update file often contains a proper subset of the hashes found in the previous one, i.e. some hashes are added, other -- removed. A similar pattern is observed in the way X.509 certificates (unlike in Windows, UEFI forum's updates unitize signatures of type `EFI_CERT_X509_GUID`) are handled: two certificates appear in the `dbxupdate.bin` (dated `2020-07-29`), the update released on October, 12th adds one more certificate to the set, and finally, on the 29th of April, 2021 all three mysteriously disappear. For the latter, at least, we have an explanation for this update comes with [release notes](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/UEFI_Secure_Boot_DBX_Revocation_List_2021_Readme.pdf). Here is an extract taken therefrom.

> -- Added 31 vulnerable shim versions signed by Microsoft UEFI CA 2011.<br/>
> -- Replaced Cisco, Debian and Canonical subordinate CAs with shim hashes to save memory.<br/>
> -- Removed shim not leveraging GRUB and therefore not vulnerable.<br/>

Apparently, the certificates in question had been used to sign vulnerable modules (shims, in particular) and in the new update file, they were replaced by the hashes of said modules. Furthermore, `211-180 = 31` new hashes were added and `183-180 = 3` hashed were removed as belonging to the modules not longer deemed vulnerable. This update, it seems, is meant to undo some of the changes made by the one preceding it and, therefore, calling `SetVariable()` with `EFI_VARIABLE_APPEND_WRITE` set will not achieve the desired effect. How the update was actually performed by the operating systems that chose to apply `dbxupdate.bin` from the Forum, I leave to the reader to figure out for, you see, a truly valuable work leaves some problems open, thereby providing the research community with something to pursue :-).

## Conclusion

Of course, setting out on a mission to prove that it was a particular update that loaded some hash value into an NVRAM variable is rather silly and the result, in itself, is not worth the time and effort we put in. The real purpose behind the undertaking was to broaden our knowledge. One tiny problem, solved trivially by upgrading Ubuntu LiveCD, comes our way and look how much we have learned! We have learned about OS security objectives and the role Secure Boot plays in achieving them, gotten familiar with specifics of Secure Boot operation and the associated PKI. Now we know about the new type of Windows updates involving differential compression and have an idea (albeit a bit vague) of what is inside the update packages. We dissected the binary format Secure Boot-related variables (and the files that hold patches for them) comply with and have learned how to parse it uncovering a few quaint design decisions along the way.

It was a study beneficial in every way (the effect it had on my meeting deadlines notwithstanding, but hey, if you are procrastinating, at least do it the right way). Thank you for staying till the end.
